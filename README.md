# level-move

Move a value to another key, inside a LevelDB. Uses [level-lock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/level-lock) to prevent concurrent operations from causing race conditions.

## Example

```js
var level = require('level');
var move = require('level-move');

var db = level(__dirname + '/db');
move.install(db);

db.put('foo', 'bar', function(err) {
  db.move('foo', 'yolo', function(err) {
    if (err && err.code === 'LOCKED') {
      console.error('conflict');
    }
    
    db.get('yolo', function(err, value) {
      console.log('yolo: %s', value);
      // => yolo: bar
    });
  });
});
```

## API

### move(db, from, to, cb)

Move the value stored under `from` to `to` and call `cb` when done. If the key is locked by a concurrent operation the error passed to `cb` will have `err.code` equal `'LOCKED'`.

### move.install(db)
### db.move(from, to, cb)

Install `level-move` onto `db`.

## Installation

With [npm](https://npmjs.org) do:

```bash
npm install level-move
```
